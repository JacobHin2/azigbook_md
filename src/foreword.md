# Foreword

This book targets people who already have experience programming in other
languages. 

Having experience in a systems programming language like C or
Rust can help but having something like intermediate level in Python is
enough to understand the book's concepts.

Being that the book is still very early, send any and all feedback to: Zen1th#3854.
There is also a GitHub repository, where you can help improve the book.

Complementary material you should also want to use to learn Zig:

- [The Standard Library Source](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/lib/std): It is well written and shows idiomatic Zig at it's finest.
  - Also it is the most recommended way to learn the standard library pre Zig 1.0.
- [The Reference](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/) - an in-depth overview of the language.
- [ziglearn](https://ziglearn.org) -  bare introductions in a bulleted list style.
- [ziglings](https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings) - like [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) but for Zig.
- [Zig Examples](https://github.com/Mouvedia/zig-examples/blob/main/zig.html.markdown) - an excellent collection of code snippets for the main syntax.

## Why Zig?
